# Overcoming Theoretical Limitations of Soft Attention

Authors: Giacomo Camposampiero, Bernhard Hilmarsson, Franz Nowak, and Clemente Pasti

Date: 31st July 2022

This README provides an overview of the code developed for our project on limitations of soft attention.

The dependencies needed to run our code are listed in ``requirements.txt``.

## Exact Experiments
To recreate our results for exact implementations run ``exact_experiments.sh``

## Example of floating point precision error
Running ``floating_point_error.py`` will show a similar floating point error that will affect the results of Palindrome (for perfect precision, the result should be 0).

## Feature list
